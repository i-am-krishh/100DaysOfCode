# printing variables
print("value of the x is: ",x)
print("value of the y is: ",y)

# Typecasting
a = int('55')
b = float(55)
c = int(a)
# print(c)
print("Type of a is ",type(a))
print("Type of b is ",type(b))
print("Type of c is ",type(c))


# Challenge 
'''print the type of the variable'''

# solution
# print("Type of b is ",(type(b).__name__))
